# Weather Project

A project that fetches weather reports based on location.

Uses OpenWeatherMap's API to get **hourly** weather reports based on user's current UI.

I'm using some code from another project I made, [Sunshine](https://github.com/deep-concern/sunshine). That app requires a zip code (no automatic location polling), but outputs **daily** weather data in a more readable format. Please take a look at that to see some implementations of Settings, fancier UI, etc.
